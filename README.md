# Problem

Aline is a technical thought leader marketing her new book Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. She wants to leave helpful Reddit comments using our tool.

Our AI generates great personal comments (eg: ADHD founder). But it's weak on technical ones (eg: Options trader)

If we can't fix this, we'll lose important customers like Aline.

Right now, our tool pulls from a user's knowledgebase to generate comments.

To help Aline, we need to import her technical knowledge (blogs, guides, and book) into that knowledgebase.

## Your Task

Build a scraper that pulls content into our knowledgebase format.

Sources to scrape:
- Every blog post on interviewing.io: https://interviewing.io/blog
- Every company guide here: https://interviewing.io/topics#companies
- Every interview guide here: https://interviewing.io/learn#interview-guides
- All of Nil's DS&A blog posts: https://nilmamano.com/blog/category/dsa
- First 8 chapters of her book (PDF) Google Drive Link (Chunk this)
- Make it work for any blog (eg: https://quill.co/blog - I will be testing on a bunch of blogs)
